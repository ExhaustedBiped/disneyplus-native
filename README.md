# disneyplus native
 A proof of concept attempt at running the Disney+ site in its own window.

This app was written in python and uses PyQt WebEngine to render the site. (Thus, you will need PyQt, which can be installed with `pip install pyqt`)

I didn't work with Disney on this, thats why I had to use a generic plus sign from the internet. This will probably become a thing that I do now with sites I 
think could do with an app. (This is how the Amazon app works, kinda.)

## TODO:
- Save login info
- Make it load faster?
- Add settings?
